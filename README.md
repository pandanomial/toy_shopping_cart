# toy_shopping_cart

This is a text-based shopping cart app.

Support two kinds of toys - add a String to Toy with the toy's name.

Support multiple stores. Ask user what store they are going to (out of 2 is fine).If a store is out of stock, give a message telling them to go to other store if the other store has any, but they have to pay for their cart before they leave.

Store toys - pointers to dynamic objects, not just objects.
 
Put toy they want in cart. But tell them you are out if no toys left

Give Toy a price property and a price. When the user exits, tell them how much they spent by looking at the cart
