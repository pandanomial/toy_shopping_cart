# toy_shopping_cart

This is a text-based shopping cart app.

It supports multiple stores. It asks users what store they are going to (out of 2 is fine). If a store is out of stock, then it gives a message telling them to go to other store if the other store has any, but they have to pay for their cart before they leave.

It supports two kinds of toys - add a String to Toy with the toy's name.

It stores toys - pointers to dynamic objects, not just objects.
 
It puts toys they want in shopping cart and tell users if the toys are sold out.

It gives Toy a price property and a price. When the users exit, tells them how much they spent by looking at the cart.
